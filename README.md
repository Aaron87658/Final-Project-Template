## Analyzing Ocean Current Patterns

Aaron Le 
OCEAN 215 Final Project  
Autumn 2024  

*This project studies the factors that shape global ocean current patterns using satellite altimetry and on site measurements. The main goal is to examine temporal variations, find long-term trends, and understand how external drivers like wind and salinity changes affect these patterns. Key results show notable seasonal and decade-long shifts in current speeds and directions.
